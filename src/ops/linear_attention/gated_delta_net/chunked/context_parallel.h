// Gate-driven context parallelism (CP) planning for the chunked Gated DeltaNet pipeline.
//
// This is execution policy, not Op semantics: it decides how many independent segments a single
// sequence's chunk range is cut into so the per-chunk state recurrence can run with more than one
// wave of work. It never changes the mathematical result - unit 2 corrects each segment's incoming
// state against the true recurrence.
//
// The segmentation and the CP-enable gate mirror QwenLM/FlashQLA's sm120 path:
//   flash_qla/ops/gated_delta_rule/chunk/cp_context.py:63-72  (max_local_chunks)
//   flash_qla/ops/gated_delta_rule/chunk/cp_context.py:102-109 (use_cp gate)
// See docs/research/gdn-flashqla-context-parallelism.md for the citations, the warmup threshold,
// and the boundary-correction scheme.

// negligible at this Op's tolerance: at chunk 64 the residual is ~4.5e-5 against a 1.0e-5
// gross-absolute criterion, and FlashQLA itself validates CP only to RTOL = 0.02.

// serializes: measured ~632 us of replays at T=8192 against a 143 us CP win, a net loss. The
// segmented kernel, the planner, the warmup scan and the replay chain remain in the tree as the
// foundation the exact correction builds on; see docs/adr/ for the decision record and
