# NInfer documentation

Start with the [project README](../README.md) to build NInfer, download a published artifact, and
run the CLI or HTTP server.

## User guides

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [CLI](cli.md) | text, chat-history, image/video input, output streams, sampling, MTP, and common runtime options |
| [HTTP serving](serving.md) | OpenAI Responses/Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, state, streaming, token counting, authentication, and tool calls |
| [Performance](performance.md) | RTX 5090 measurement coverage, per-model serving results, methodology, and publication rules |
| [Weight conversion](weight-conversion.md) | official recipes, custom formats and sources, conversion methods, optional components and artifact output |
| [Perplexity](perplexity.md) | fixed-corpus and custom-text causal perplexity, comparison rules, progress, and reports |
| [opencode settings](opencode-settings.md) | the four shipped model entries, compaction, and the concurrency answer for OpenCode Desktop |
| [v2 to v3 flag diff](v2-v3-flag-diff.md) | what changed between the retired v2 launchers and the shipped v3 ones, flag by flag |
| [CLI examples](../examples/cli/) | committed text, multimodal, thinking, long-decode, and long-context inputs |

The executable `--help` output is the exact source for command-line option spelling and defaults.

## Model artifacts

This port ships two, and the launchers use them:

| Model | Weights | Download | Versioned model card source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.8-27B | `nvfp4qat` (QUASAR) | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/cometkim/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4qat-NInfer) | [model card](../model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4qat-NInfer/README.md) |
| Qwen3.8-27B | `nvfp4full` | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/cometkim/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4full-NInfer) | card lives in that repository |

Upstream publishes artifacts for other checkpoints, each with its own model card on its own
repository. This port ships none of them and keeps no copy of their pages:
[upstream's README](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer#readme) is their authority.

The storage contract both shipped artifacts implement is the
[Qwen3.8-27B artifact reference](maintainer/qwen3.8-27b-artifact.md): identity, object inventory,
formats, layouts, aliases and source transforms, with the `nvfp4full` and `nvfp4qat` profiles in
Sections 14 and 15.

## Maintainer references

The active references under [`maintainer/`](maintainer/) record current architecture, model,
artifact, and maintenance contracts. These files are not additional user workflows or installed
API documentation.

[`adr/`](adr/) holds the decisions behind the shipped profiles and artifact rules, each with the
measurement that produced it: why a v3 container is required, why speculation is not bit-identical,
the draft-binding contract, why the profiles are vision-only, and why every profile flag is
measured rather than chosen.

[Engine architecture](maintainer/engine-architecture.md) is the single top-level reference. The
other references own narrower contracts:

| Document | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [Engine architecture](maintainer/engine-architecture.md) | model/config/weight ownership, loading-to-execution flow, requests, scheduling, transactions and graphs |
| [Build system](maintainer/build-system.md) | CMake targets, explicit source ownership, CUDA compilation boundaries, presets and developer configuration |
| [Artifact container](maintainer/artifact-container.md) | v3 directory, objects, logical bindings, Uses, resources and file framing/sharding |
| [Numeric formats](maintainer/tensor-formats.md) | represented values, codes/scales, conversion arithmetic and numerical interpretation |
| [Storage layouts](maintainer/storage-layouts.md) | packing, plane offsets, padding, encoded sizes and view addressing |
| [Qwen3.5 model](maintainer/qwen3_5-model.md) | Dense/MoE mathematics, instance config, logical parameters, MTP, Vision and state semantics |
| [DFlash and DFlash2](maintainer/dflash.md) | conditioning, masked draft computation, proposal distributions and backend state |
| [Resource scheduling and context cache](maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md) | candidate selection, retention, materialization and Device/Host checkpoint policy |
| [Paged KV context store](maintainer/paged-kv-cache.md) | typed pools, pages, replicas, address spaces, reservations and consumer views |
| [ReplaySSM GDN](maintainer/replayssm-gdn.md) | raw transition records and faithful commitment of the verified state prefix |
| [Op development](maintainer/op-development.md) | semantic boundaries, source ownership, numerical qualification and performance evidence |
| [Operational logging](maintainer/logging.md) | log ownership, presentation, severity and data policy |
| [Linear benchmark](maintainer/linear-benchmark.md) | pure Linear measurement, metrics and suites |
| [Linear tuning and reports](maintainer/linear-tuning.md) | tuning ranges, priority points, dispatch tradeoffs and final performance report format |

Model cards contain official artifact facts and source provenance. The
[conversion guide](weight-conversion.md) is the entry point for making an artifact. Exact config
fields, parameter expansion and native supported domains are maintained by the code linked from
these references.
