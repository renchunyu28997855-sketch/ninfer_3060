# Upstream reports

Three issues found while working on this port, each written up with a reproduction and
evidence so it can be filed as-is. **None has been posted.** They are drafts, and posting them is
an outbound action rather than a code change.

**Pulling an upstream release?** Read [`fork-divergence.md`](fork-divergence.md) first. It records
which of our changes touch files upstream also owns, and which are Windows-permanent and cannot
conflict. `dev` is a strict superset of `upstream/master` (0 commits behind), so the only risk is
recognising our own patches when upstream edits the same shared logic.

| Report | Target | What it is | Strength |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ninfer-tma-descriptor-graph-capture.md` | `Neroued/ninfer`, aimed at the open Windows/TMA PRs `#233` and `#82` | the device-buffer TMA descriptor path is not safe under CUDA Graph capture | strongest: a `compute-sanitizer` trace, a named mechanism, and a fix |
| `codegraph-init-replaces-junction.md` | `@colbymchenry/codegraph` 1.5.0 | `init` replaces a junction/symlink with an empty directory, then reports "No files found to index" | reproduction, no fix |
| `ninfer-reasoning-effort-mismatch.md` | `Neroued/ninfer` | the engine advertises six `reasoning_effort` values; the artifact's chat template accepts four, so `minimal` and `high` return HTTP 400 after passing validation | a two-line change either way |

## The formerly failing test, and the fix

The suite is 122/122. `ninfer_resource_manager_test`'s
`test_candidate_search_prefers_deep_reuse_without_eviction` used to fail and was recorded in
`tools/release/test_baseline.json`; that record is now empty.

The earlier reading here -- a 5 ms **wall-clock** budget, so the outcome depends on the machine --
was wrong. `950c87cb` had already let the planner take a caller-supplied clock, and the outcome is
unchanged with it, so the failure was deterministic policy rather than timing. The optional search's
initial grant was `min(5 ms, incumbent_cost / 20, allowance)`, and the flat 5 ms cap dominated
because a root incumbent's `/20` term is hundreds of milliseconds and never binds. The search
verified too few targets to reach the two-action preserving closure, so one-step eviction won the
incumbent; on a busy engine the same cap let a reuse target go unconfirmed and admission fell back
to the root incumbent, re-prefilling the whole prompt (upstream issue #229, TTFT 142 s -> 1.2 s
once the grant scales).

The fix scales the grant up to a 250 ms ceiling (`materialization_budget.h`, `kMaximumGrantNs`),
with the economic term still governing below the ceiling and the boundary allowance capping both.
It was committed as `2fcffaa9`, reverted as `7ae7bb40` with no recorded reason, and re-landed here.
See `docs/research/prefix-state-eviction.md`.

## Not a bug: the fused DFlash2 binding

Worth recording so nobody re-derives it. This tree at one point required a fused
`dflash2/layers/*/attention/query_key_value` parameter. **Upstream is consistent and correct
here**: `load/dflash.cpp` binds the separate `attention/query`, `attention/key` and
`attention/value`, and `parameters.cpp` assembles the fused parent itself with
`ops::prepare_attn_input_proj_weights`. `tools/convert/qwen3_5.py` groups those three rather
than emitting a fused name. The fused *binding* was our own divergence, and it is why
upstream-shaped artifacts (the official Qwen3.8-27B image, community fuller-NVFP4 images)
were refused at startup. It is fixed in `9898ecb1`; there is nothing to report upstream.
